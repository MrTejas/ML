# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch. Each algorithm is coded in Python without relying on external libraries to provide a clear understanding of the underlying principles.

## Implemented Algorithms:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
   - Implementation for both regression and classification tasks
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
5. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Clustering**
6. **Ensemble Methods:**
   - Bagging
   - Stacking
   - Adaboost
   - Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT)
   - Random Forests

## Getting Started:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrTejas/ML-Algos.git
cd ML-Algos
